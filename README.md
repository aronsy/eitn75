This repository contains a collection of jupyter notebooks that is used in the course EITN75 at the Department of Electrical and Information Technology (EIT), Faculty of Engineering at Lund University.

The first notebook covers the installation process to obtain a working Python3+jupyter environment. After following that, one should be able to run the notebooks offline on a local machine.

GitHub should generate static HTML pages out of the notebooks. But, sometimes it doesn't work. Then, use the [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) and paste the link to the notebook.
